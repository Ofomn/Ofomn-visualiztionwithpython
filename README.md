# DATA VISUALIZATION WITH PYTHON
---
## Creating Stacked Chart (Histogram) 


### Introduction

The dataset I would be using is the *Insurance* dataset which would be imported from the `pycaret.dateset`.

I would be using a stacked chart for our visualization.

A stacked chart is a type of bar chart that displays the relationship and structure of a restricted amount of variables through duration, whether they be relative or absolute.

For  this project, I would be using the built-in `hist()` function from pandas to plot a histogram for age, BMI, and charges against the target variable which is **Insurance Charges** for each person.


## Data

The data used originates from the book [Machine Learning with R](https://www.amazon.com/Machine-Learning-R-Brett-Lantz/dp/1782162143/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&linkCode=ll1&tag=learnds-20&linkId=acc9debcffa9ec9b8dc01374ead56eaf&language=en_US) by Brett Lantz, and it contains health insurance information.

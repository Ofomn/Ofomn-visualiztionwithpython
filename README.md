## Creating Stacked Chart (Histogram) 


### Introduction

A stacked chart is a type of bar chart that displays the relationship and structure of a restricted amount of variables through duration, whether they be relative or absolute.

For  this project, we would be using the built-in `hist()` function from pandas to plot a histogram for age, BMI, and charges.

# DATA VISUALIZATION WITH PYTHON
---
## Creating Stacked Chart (Histogram) 


### Introduction

The dataset we would be using is the *Insurance* dataset which would be imported from the `pycaret.dateset`.

We would be using a stacked chart for our visualization.


A stacked chart is a type of bar chart that displays the relationship and structure of a restricted amount of variables through duration, whether they be relative or absolute.

For  this project, we would be using the built-in `hist()` function from pandas to plot a histogram for age, BMI, and charges.
